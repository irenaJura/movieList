A movie list application in React that retrieves data from a
local JSON file and runs in the browser with webpack and Babel. 

Styling was done using Bootstrap. 

The application returns a list of the highest-grossing movies as of 2019, along with some more details and a poster for every movie.

Topics I learned in this mini project:

Setting up a new project with webpack and React
Structuring a React project
